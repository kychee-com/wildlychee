/**
 * Copied-site path-alias resolver.
 *
 * `[...alias].astro` resolves `path_aliases` (source path → port path) and
 * 301s, but as a rest-param route it has the LOWEST Astro precedence — so a
 * single-segment inbound path like `/Classified-Ads` is claimed by the
 * higher-precedence `[customPage].astro` (a named `[param]` route). That route
 * is `prerender=true` with a `getStaticPaths` allow-list, so an unknown slug
 * never runs its body — Astro just serves the built-in 404 and `[...alias]`
 * never sees the request. Relying on `[...alias].astro` alone would 404
 * single-segment aliases (the common case — capitalized source slugs mapping
 * to lowercase port slugs) even though nested-path aliases work.
 *
 * Middleware runs BEFORE route matching, so resolving aliases here sidesteps
 * route precedence entirely and covers single- and multi-segment alike. Real
 * pages are prerendered static files served by the gateway without invoking
 * this function; only SSR requests (unmatched paths, `prerender=false` routes)
 * reach here, and `resolvePathAlias` returns null for anything that isn't a
 * seeded alias key (and for self-redirects), so normal routing is untouched.
 *
 * `path_aliases` is fetched once per Lambda lifetime and cached: the map only
 * changes on redeploy, which restarts the function. Fail-open — a config read
 * miss leaves aliases null and requests fall through to normal routing.
