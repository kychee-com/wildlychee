## Context

Kychon portals are Astro sites rendered from a `sections` table where every visible block — header, main, footer — is a row addressed by `(page_slug, zone, scope, section_type, config JSONB)`. Admins edit live pages via `data-editable*` attributes wired to an `AdminEditor.astro` island; non-admin visitors see none of that chrome. The engine ships with a block registry (`src/lib/blocks.ts`) that is both the build-time bake renderer and the runtime hydrator, giving a single isomorphic render path.

This change adds five orthogonal capabilities (admin bar, page management, media library, block translation, block list editor) plus embed expansion. All five share the constraint that they must be invisible to non-admins and must compose cleanly with the existing zone/scope/position model, the existing `kychon-api.js` mutation gateway, and the shadcn/Tailwind UI stack.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Persistent admin bar above every page for admins: page navigation, new-page creation, block picker shortcut, translation mode, preview.
- Page CRUD: create with nav auto-insert, delete with nav auto-remove and block cascade.
- Media library: track all uploaded assets in DB; replace bare file-input on image edits with a two-pane picker Dialog.
- Block translation: per-locale partial config overrides stored in `section_translations`; render-time deep-merge; field-by-field editor with AI-fill.
- Block list editor: Popover CRUD (add / drag-reorder / inline-edit / delete) for all blocks whose config has a top-level items array.
- Embed expansion: 5 new verified providers; `referrerpolicy` on all iframes.

**Non-Goals:**

- Stripe embed provider (deferred — payment flows need separate consent and CSP review).
- Facebook/Instagram embed providers (deferred — tracking pixel disclosure UI needed first).
- Dedicated `/admin/media` management page (modal picker is sufficient for MVP).
- Page templates or starter layouts (blank canvas + add blocks is the model for now).
- Translation of dynamic block data (announcements, events, etc.) — those rows already use `content_translations`.
- Member-facing language preference UI changes — `i18n` spec is unchanged.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Admin bar is a Portal.astro-level island, not a block

The admin bar must appear on every page, above the header zone, and be completely invisible to non-admins. Making it a `sections` block would require it to have a `page_slug` and a `scope`, and the zone/scope query would need to include it — bloating every page render with admin-only data.

Instead, `Portal.astro` renders `<AdminBar />` unconditionally just before the flex column (same slot as `<DemoBanner />`). The `AdminBarIsland.tsx` React island self-hides when `getRole()` is not `'admin'`, so non-admins receive the HTML node but it has `display: none` applied before paint. The island is `client:load` so it initialises immediately on admin sessions.

Alternative considered: a separate `admin.css` that shows a `#admin-bar` element only with the `.admin-mode` body class. Rejected because it requires coordinating class application before first paint; the island approach is self-contained.

### Decision 2: pages.create and pages.delete are lifted to custom handlers in kychon-api.js

The generic `insertRow` / `deleteRow` path in `kychon-api.js` handles straightforward table writes. Both page operations need side-effects: `pages.create` must optionally append a nav item to the global `nav` block's `config.items`; `pages.delete` must cascade-delete page-scoped sections and remove the matching nav item.

These side-effects require the handler to query the `sections` table (find the nav block), read its `config`, compute a new `config.items` array, and issue a second write — all inside one request. The generic path cannot express this.

Lifting to custom handlers keeps the mutation auth model (operation allowlist, admin-only gate) intact while allowing multi-step logic. The nav side-effect is best-effort: if no global `nav` block exists, the page is created/deleted successfully and the client receives a `nav_not_found: true` flag in the response payload, which the AdminBarIsland converts to a toast.

Alternative considered: a separate edge function. Rejected — adds a new deployment artifact and breaks the single-API-gateway model for page mutations.

### Decision 3: media library is backed by Run402 v1.50 `assets.list`, not a Kychon-side DB table

**No Kychon-side `media_assets` shadow table is needed** — `internal.blobs.metadata` is a flat JSONB column the caller writes via `assets.put` opts, the `assets.list` route serves sorted/filtered media-picker queries directly (5 partial indexes back it), and intrinsic image fields (`width_px`, `height_px`, `blurhash`, `image_format`, `image_info`, `image_exif`) are populated server-side on every upload. A shadow table would carry three problems: (1) dual-write on every upload and delete, with drift on partial failure; (2) assets uploaded outside Kychon invisible until manually re-uploaded; (3) every CMS-shaped Kychon-adjacent app reimplementing the same table independently.

**Upload path.** `upload-asset.js` calls `r.project(id).assets.put(path, bytes, { contentType, metadata: { filename, uploaded_by: member_id }, exifPolicy: 'strip' })`. The `metadata` JSONB is opaque to the platform (4 KB cap, flat shape — Kychon's three fields fit comfortably). `exifPolicy: 'strip'` is Kychon's default because end-user photos may carry GPS / camera serial / owner identifiers — the original bytes still serve through `cdn_url` (we never mutate CAS) but the queryable `image_exif` stays sanitized. Admins can re-upload an asset with `exifPolicy: 'keep'` later if they need full EXIF.

**Read path.** `media.list` is a thin wrapper:

```js
const { blobs, next_cursor } = await r.project(projectId).assets.list({
  prefix: 'images/',
  sort: 'createdAt:desc',
  limit: 40,
  cursor,
});
return { assets: blobs, nextCursor: next_cursor };
```

The picker reads `metadata.filename`, `width_px`, `height_px`, `image_format`, `variants.thumb.cdn_url` (or `cdn_url` for below-thumb-sized originals) — all top-level fields on each row.

**Filter capability falls out for free.** v1.50's `filter.uploaded_by`, `filter.format`, `filter.is_image`, `filter.min_width`/`max_width`/`min_height`/`max_height`, `filter.tag` all hit indexed partial indexes. A future "show only photos I uploaded" view costs zero additional Kychon code.

**Delete path.** `media.delete` calls `r.project(id).assets.delete(path)` for the storage row + variant revocation. The in-use check (`SELECT 1 FROM sections WHERE config::text LIKE '%' || $cdn_url || '%' LIMIT 1` plus the same check on `site_config`) stays on the Kychon side because it's portal-specific. A warning Dialog (not a hard block) is shown when the image appears to be in use.

**No backfill required.** Every asset in `internal.blobs` is visible via `r.assets.list`. Assets uploaded outside the Kychon upload path show up with `metadata: null`; admins can re-upload to populate metadata, or live with `null` since the asset still renders.

Alternative considered: keep a `media_assets` table for application-specific fields beyond what v1.50 indexes (e.g. captions, alt text, tags). Rejected — those fields ARE caller-provided metadata; the v1.50 4 KB JSONB cap accommodates them. If Kychon ever needs cross-asset joins (e.g. "all assets tagged 'sponsor'"), `filter.tag` handles it server-side.


### Decision 4: section_translations stores partial config JSONB, not field-by-field rows

The existing `content_translations` table uses `(content_type, content_id, language, field, translated_text TEXT)` — one row per translated field. For block configs, fields can be nested arrays (`items[].title`) and the complete set of translatable fields varies per block type. Storing them field-by-field would require either serialising array paths as strings (`"items[0].title"`) or expanding each array element into its own row — both are fragile when items are reordered.

`section_translations.config JSONB` stores only the translated fields as a partial config mirror:

```json
{ "heading": "Bienvenidos", "items": [{ "title": "Portal de Miembros" }, { "title": "Eventos" }] }
```

The renderer merges at call site: `deepMerge(section.config, translation.config)`. Array merge is by index: `translation.config.items[i]` is spread over `section.config.items[i]`, so untranslated item fields fall back to the base config. This is safe because the translation editor always writes the full array for `items[]` fields — it never writes a partial array.

Alternative considered: add `{en: "...", es: "..."}` multilingual objects directly into `sections.config`. Rejected — complicates every read path (the renderer would need to know the locale to pick the right value), breaks the single-language seed model, and makes JSONB config larger and harder to validate.

### Decision 5: BlockType registry gains editorType and translatableFields

Both the `BlockListEditor` (which block types get the Popover CRUD) and the `BlockTranslationEditor` (which fields get translation inputs) are driven by declarations on the block registry entry — not by component-level special-casing per block type.

`editorType: 'inline' | 'list' | 'custom'` tells the admin editing system which editor to mount for a block's edit affordance. `translatableFields: string[]` lists the dot-path fields that appear in the translation editor (empty array = block is not translatable).

This keeps the `AdminEditor.astro` orchestration logic thin — it reads the registry and delegates. Adding a new block type requires only a registry entry; no new editor component is needed unless the block has bespoke editing requirements (like `embed`).

### Decision 6: shadcn Popover for BlockListEditor, shadcn Dialog for BlockTranslationEditor and MediaPicker

`BlockListEditor` is triggered from the block's edit affordance (a small button overlaid on the block). A `Popover` anchored to that button is the right affordance — it appears near the block, stays on screen while the admin interacts with the list, and dismisses on outside click.

`BlockTranslationEditor` and `MediaPicker` are heavier interactions (field-by-field editing, scrollable image grid) that benefit from a centred `Dialog` with a `ScrollArea`. The Dialog's focus-trap and backdrop also signal to the admin that they are in a distinct editing context.

Alternative considered: `Sheet` (slide-over drawer) for MediaPicker to give more horizontal space. Rejected — `Sheet` is not in the current component set and the two-pane Dialog at `max-w-3xl` gives sufficient room.

### Decision 7: Embed referrerpolicy gap is fixed in this change

All existing iframe renders in `src/lib/blocks/embed.ts` lack `referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`. Without it, embedded iframes receive the full Referer header including any path/slug the member is visiting. Adding the attribute to every iframe render is a one-line fix per provider call site and should ship with the provider expansion rather than as a standalone change.

### Decision 8: Image fields in block configs persist the full AssetRef, not the URL string

Storing the URL string alone would force a runtime manifest lookup in `src/lib/kychon-image.ts`, because the build-time `@run402/astro` manifest does not know about admin-uploaded runtime images. Persisting the AssetRef removes that lookup entirely.

When the admin saves an image via the MediaPicker, the block config field SHALL persist the full v1.49 `AssetRef` object returned by `r.assets.put` — including `cdn_url`, `width_px`, `height_px`, `blurhash`, and the `variants.{thumb, medium, large, display_jpeg}` ladder. At render time the renderer detects whether the field is a string (legacy) or an object (AssetRef-shaped):

- **AssetRef-shaped field**: passes directly to `renderPicture(ref, opts)` from `@run402/astro/manifest`. No lookup, no cache, no manifest dependency. The row IS the variant data.
- **String-shaped field**: falls through the existing `kychonImageHtml(url, alt, opts, manifest)` path that looks up the URL in the build-time `@run402/astro` manifest, with a final fallback to plain `<img>` on miss.

Both paths remain so seeded configs with legacy string URLs keep working unchanged. New MediaPicker saves and any subsequent migration of legacy fields write the AssetRef shape.

Cost trade-off: AssetRef adds ~600–1000 bytes per image to the JSONB blob. A hero block with one `bg_image` grows by ~1 KB; a slideshow with 10 slides grows by ~10 KB. Acceptable for Postgres/PostgREST at the portal scales Kychon targets (≤200 sections per portal).

Re-upload edge case: variant URLs are content-addressed (each carries its own `sha256`). If an admin uploads new bytes under the same storage key while embedded refs in old block configs still reference the old variants, the old refs continue serving the old bytes via their immutable URLs. For Kychon's MediaPicker flow this is not a real case — new uploads get fresh path-keys; "replace" is conceptually `delete + upload to new key + update block config`. The block update writes the new AssetRef atomically with everything else in `sections.config`.

Migration: existing seeded configs (`bg_image: "/custom/assets/hero.jpg"`) keep working via the legacy string path. A one-shot migration script can resolve each string URL to an AssetRef via `r.assets.list?key=…` and rewrite the JSONB. Not required for this change; can ship separately.

What this decision keeps out of the change:
- No `runtime-asset-cache` localStorage layer
- No render-time `r.assets.list?key=…` lookup in the hot path
- No dependency on a runtime asset manifest endpoint
- Smaller diff to `src/lib/kychon-image.ts` — just AssetRef-shape detection at the entry point

### Decision 9: Pre-allocate the locale pool in `spec.i18n.locales`, control runtime enablement via `site_config.languages_enabled`

The admin "Add Language" Dialog needs runtime-mutable locales, which the platform does not expose directly; the workaround below needs no platform change. Run402's `spec.i18n.locales` is capped at 50 entries. Kychon SHALL pre-declare a fixed 50-entry pool of candidate locales at deploy time, then control which of those are visible/active to admins via a runtime-mutable `site_config.languages_enabled` JSONB array. The gateway accepts any of the 50; the application chooses what to expose.

**Two distinct concepts:**

| State | Lives in | Purpose | Mutability |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| `spec.i18n.locales` (50 entries) | Run402 release inventory | Gateway-accepted cookie/Accept-Language values | Frozen per deploy |
| `site_config.languages_enabled` | Project DB (JSONB row in `site_config`) | UI surface: what admin bar's switcher shows, what AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES filter shows | Runtime-mutable via admin |

**The flow with the kitchen-sink pool:**

```
Admin clicks "+ Add language → français"
  → UPSERT site_config.languages_enabled = [..., 'fr']           ← runtime
  → no deploy required, no platform call
  → admin bar switcher now lists français

Visitor with Cookie: wl_locale=fr
  → gateway: 'fr' is in spec.i18n.locales (pre-declared) → ctx.locale = 'fr'
  → app render path: ctx.locale !== ctx.defaultLocale
                     AND ctx.locale ∈ site_config.languages_enabled
  → LEFT JOIN section_translations WHERE language = 'fr'
  → deep-merge translated config over base
  → French visitor sees French content correctly

Admin removes français from languages_enabled (DISABLED, not deleted)
  → site_config.languages_enabled = [..., (no 'fr')]
  → admin bar switcher no longer lists français
  → section_translations rows in 'fr' linger (cheap; lets admin re-enable without retranslating)
  → render-time enabled check: ctx.locale 'fr' NOT in languages_enabled
    → skip the JOIN, fall back to base config
    → French-cookie visitor now sees default-locale content
```

**The 50-entry pool.** Kychon defines a fixed `LOCALE_POOL` constant in `scripts/_lib.ts` (or a shared module). The pool covers the top 50 ISO 639-1 base codes by combined web-usage and community-platform relevance: en, es, fr, de, it, pt, nl, sv, da, no, fi, pl, ru, uk, cs, hu, ro, bg, hr, sk, sl, lt, lv, et, ja, zh, zh-Hant, ko, ar, he, fa, tr, hi, bn, ur, ta, id, ms, tl, vi, th, sw, am, af, ca, eu, ga, cy, el, is. (Exact list lives in the constant, not the spec — drift-without-redeploy is fine because the pool is frozen at deploy time anyway.)

Run402's matching rules (verified against `deploy.types.d.ts`):
- Cookie matches case-insensitive direct against `locales[]`
- Accept-Language uses longest-matching-prefix lookup (RFC 4647 §3.4), so `Accept-Language: pt-BR` resolves to `pt` if `pt` is in the pool

Both rules work for base ISO 639-1 codes. Region-specific codes (en-GB, pt-BR) aren't in the pool; clients sending those Accept-Language tags get the base-code match. This is acceptable for community-portal scale.

**Migration of existing data.** Today's portals have `site_config.languages = ['en']` (or `['es', 'en']` for Barrio Unido). On deploy of this change, the deploy script SHALL:
1. Replace `spec.i18n.locales` with `LOCALE_POOL` (50 entries) instead of `site_config.languages` (1-3 entries).
2. UPSERT `site_config.languages_enabled` to mirror the existing `site_config.languages` value (so existing portals' admin UX is unchanged on first deploy).
3. Leave `site_config.languages` untouched (read-only legacy; nothing reads it after this change ships, but keeping it avoids breaking any field-by-field comparison tools).

**`buildI18nSpec` rewrite** (`scripts/_lib.ts`):

```ts
export function buildI18nSpec(seed: ProjectSeed): I18nSpec {
  const defaultEntry = seed.site_config?.default_language;
  const defaultLocale =
    defaultEntry && typeof defaultEntry === "object" && "value" in defaultEntry && typeof (defaultEntry as { value: unknown }).value === "string"
      ? (defaultEntry as { value: string }).value
      : "en";

  // defaultLocale MUST be in LOCALE_POOL (validated at build time)
  if (!LOCALE_POOL.includes(defaultLocale)) {
    throw new Error(`default_language "${defaultLocale}" not in LOCALE_POOL`);
  }

  return {
    defaultLocale,
    locales: LOCALE_POOL,
    detect: ["cookie:wl_locale", "accept-language"],
  };
}
```

**Why this is the right move (not a hack):**

1. It uses Run402 exactly as designed: the platform supports up to 50 locales; we use 50.
2. The conceptual split between "gateway-accepted" and "app-surfaced" is honest — the gateway is a routing layer; the app owns UX.
3. It is forward-compatible: if the platform makes `spec.i18n.locales` runtime-mutable, `LOCALE_POOL` becomes either runtime-extensible or unnecessary, with zero schema changes on the Kychon side. The `languages_enabled` runtime registry stays the UI source of truth regardless.
4. Zero platform dependency, zero deploy-per-language friction, full admin UX as designed.

**Trade-off:** the deploy advertises 50 locale-routing slots even though most portals only use 1-3. The gateway-side cost is negligible (just a string array on the release inventory), and the cache-key implications are limited because the JOIN check (`ctx.locale ∈ languages_enabled`) skips for un-enabled locales anyway.

#### Opt in to `unknownLocalePolicy: 'pass-through'`

Run402 supports `spec.i18n.unknownLocalePolicy: 'pass-through'`. Kychon opts in, so `buildI18nSpec()` emits:

```ts
{
  defaultLocale,
  locales: [...LOCALE_POOL],          // unchanged
  detect: ['cookie:wl_locale', 'accept-language'],
  unknownLocalePolicy: 'pass-through',
}
```

What this changes about the runtime behavior:

| Cookie / Accept-Language value | Before opt-in | After opt-in |
|---|---|---|
| In `LOCALE_POOL` (e.g. `fr`) | `ctx.locale = 'fr'` | `ctx.locale = 'fr'` (no change) |
| Outside `LOCALE_POOL` (e.g. `haw` for Hawaiian) | Falls back to `defaultLocale` | `ctx.locale = 'haw'` (verbatim) |
| Empty / no detection match | Falls back to `defaultLocale` | Falls back to `defaultLocale` (no change) |

The render-path enabled check (`ctx.locale ∈ languages_enabled`) is still what gates the `section_translations` JOIN — so the visitor with a `haw` cookie on a portal that doesn't enable Hawaiian still sees default-locale content. The opt-in only changes the value of `ctx.locale`; it does NOT bypass the enabled check.

Why we keep the pool instead of shrinking to `[defaultLocale]`:

1. Accept-Language prefix matching (RFC 4647 §3.4 lookup) needs `locales[]` entries to match against — `Accept-Language: pt-BR` resolves to `pt` only when `'pt'` is in `locales[]`. Pass-through doesn't help here because the algorithm wants an explicit match before deciding to fall through.
2. The release-inventory readback (`ReleaseInventoryI18n.locales`) is a real signal to other consumers ("which locales does this portal support?"). A 50-entry pool is informative; a 1-entry `[defaultLocale]` would obscure the actual scope.
3. The cost of carrying 50 entries is negligible (one string array on each release inventory row).

What this unlocks for the AddLanguage dialog: admins can now safely enable locales **outside the pool** without a redeploy. A near-term follow-up enhancement: add a "Custom locale…" affordance in the dialog that accepts an arbitrary BCP-47 tag (validated against `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}$/`). The render path already handles it correctly via the dual-condition check. Filed as a follow-up; not in this change's scope.

Cast note: the v2.8.1 SDK type for `I18nSpec` doesn't yet include `unknownLocalePolicy`. `buildI18nSpec` returns an intersection-cast result; drop the cast when the SDK types catch up.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Nav side-effect silent failure** — if no global `nav` block exists (custom chrome setups), the nav auto-insert is silently skipped. Mitigation: return `nav_not_found: true` in the API response; AdminBarIsland shows a toast "Page created — add it to your navigation manually."
- **section_translations array index drift** — if base config `items[]` is reordered after a translation is saved, translated item text will misalign (item 0's translation now shows on item 1). Mitigation: document that reordering items in the list editor clears existing translations for that block (show a confirmation: "Reordering will clear saved translations for this block. Continue?").
- **In-use text-scan check (`media.delete`)** — `config::text LIKE '%cdn_url%'` may produce false positives (URL substring appearing in unrelated text) or miss usages where the URL is stored with a different CDN prefix (e.g. variant URLs aren't matched by the source URL). Mitigation: the check is a warning, not a block; the admin can ignore and delete. The platform-level cascade (variant revocation, immutable-URL retention) handles the storage-side cleanup regardless.
- **admin-bar z-index layering** — `z-[9999]` may conflict with existing modal/toast z-indices. Mitigation: audit current z-indices before shipping; existing `Sonner` toasts and `Dialog` overlays use `z-50`/`z-[100]`; admin bar at `z-[9999]` is safely above them.
- **Popover width for complex list blocks** — `BlockListEditor` at `w-80` (320px) may be tight for blocks with long item text (e.g. FAQ questions). Mitigation: `w-96` for `faq` and `footer_links` overrides in the registry, or truncate with `Tooltip` on hover showing full text.
- **AI translation rate limits** — `translate-text.js` calls an external AI API; concurrent block translations may hit rate limits. Mitigation: the "Translate with AI" button is per-block, not bulk; no queueing needed for MVP.
- **AssetRef vs string-URL renderer branching** — block renderers must detect the field shape at render time and route to the AssetRef path or the legacy URL path. Mitigation: detection is a single `typeof === 'object'` check at the entry of `kychonImageHtml` / `<KychonImage>`; both paths exist anyway (legacy URL path already handles manifest miss). Type the field as `string | AssetRef` in TS to make consumer code explicit.
- **AssetRef shape drift across Run402 versions** — the embedded variant ladder is tied to the v1.49 encoder. If v1.5x changes the variant structure, existing embedded refs become a mix of old-shape and new-shape. Mitigation: `AssetRef.variant_spec_version` already exists in the v1.49 shape; renderers can branch on it. Document that any future variant-shape change requires a migration pass over `sections.config` to rewrite embedded refs.

## Migration Plan

1. Confirm the Run402 platform is on v1.50+ and `@run402/functions@^2.4.0` is available to the deployed function bundle.
2. Run `npx shadcn add scroll-area popover` to install the two new shadcn components.
3. Apply `schema.sql` additions (one `DO $$ BEGIN ALTER TABLE … ADD …` guard for `section_translations`) via `run402 db push` or the project's standard migration path. **No** `media_assets` migration — that table is intentionally absent; media metadata lives in Run402's `internal.blobs`.
4. Deploy updated `upload-asset.js` (threads `metadata: { filename, uploaded_by }` + `exifPolicy: 'strip'` through `r.project(id).assets.put`; adds an `action='list'` wrapper over `r.project(id).assets.list`). **Assets uploaded outside the Kychon upload path appear in the media library automatically** — they are in `internal.blobs`, which `assets.list` queries. Those rows show up with `metadata: null`; admins can re-upload to attach filename + uploader, or live with the unattributed entry.
5. Deploy updated `kychon-api.js` (custom page handlers + `media.*` wrappers + `sections.translate/getTranslation` operations).
6. Deploy updated Astro build (AdminBar, MediaPicker, BlockListEditor, BlockTranslationEditor, blocks.ts registry changes, Portal.astro AdminBar injection, page-render.ts translation merge, embed-providers.ts additions).
7. Verify: create a test page from the admin bar, check nav auto-insert; upload an image and see it in the picker with extracted dimensions + the recorded `filename` + `uploaded_by`; edit a hero block's ES translation and reload with locale=es.

Rollback: remove `<AdminBar />` from Portal.astro and revert `upload-asset.js` and `kychon-api.js` to prior versions. The one new table (`section_translations`) is empty and additive — dropping is safe. The `data-editable-image` trigger can revert to direct file-input independently. **No DB cleanup needed for the media library** — it's all platform-side state already managed by Run402's CAS GC and immutable-URL retention.

## Open Questions

- Should reordering items in the BlockListEditor clear existing `section_translations` for that block, or attempt to preserve them by re-indexing? The safe default is to clear and warn; re-indexing is error-prone if items are also added or removed in the same operation.
- Should the admin bar's language switcher show only languages with at least one `section_translations` row, or all languages in `site_config.languages`? Showing all configured languages is simpler and lets admins start translating in a language before any block has been translated.
- Should a one-shot migration script convert existing seeded `image_url: "string"` block-config fields to embedded `AssetRef` objects in the same change, or ship separately? Argues for separate: the legacy string path still works; migration is cleanup, not blocking. Argues for same change: ensures every block in production is on the same shape, simplifies renderer telemetry.

## Future Cleanup (follow-up changes)

- **Function-level role gates (Run402 #397 — accepted, awaiting implementation).** When Run402 ships declarative `requireAuth: true` + `requireRole: { table, idColumn, roleColumn, allowed, cacheTtl }` on function deploy spec, drop the per-function `SELECT role FROM members WHERE user_id = $1` checks across `functions/upload-asset.js`, `functions/upload-resource.js`, `functions/kychon-api.js`, `functions/translate-content.js`, `functions/moderate-content.js`, `functions/export-csv.js`, `functions/site-search.js`. Replace with declarative gates on the function deploy spec; `ctx.role` becomes pre-populated. Mechanical migration, low risk per function. File as its own change `migrate-to-declarative-role-gates` once Run402 #397 lands.
- **Legacy image-URL → AssetRef migration.** A one-shot script that walks `sections.config` (and `site_config.value` for branding fields), resolves each string-URL image field via `r.assets.list?key=…`, and rewrites the field to the embedded AssetRef shape. Removes the dual-path branching from `src/lib/kychon-image.ts` once complete. File as its own change `migrate-block-image-fields-to-assetref` after this one ships.
